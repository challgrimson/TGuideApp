    <!--String for About Turner Syndrom -->
    <string name="whatTurner">What is Turner Syndrome?</string>
    <string name="whatTurnerAns">Turner Syndrome (TS) is a condition that affects only girls and women.
    Most people have 23 pairs of chromosomes, with 1 pair being sex chromosomes. Most males have
    an X and Y sex chromosome and most females have two X chromosomes. In TS, there
    is an absence of all or part of the second X chromosome in some or all of the cells of the body.
    </string>
    <string name="typesTurner">Are there different types of Turner Syndrome?</string>
    <string name="typesTurnerAns">There are multiple types of TS. Females who
    are completely missing an X chromosome have "classic" TS. Others are missing only
    part of the second X chromosome or have structural rearrangements of the chromosome. In some
    females, only some cells are missing the X chromosome, known as a mosaic karyotype. Knowing your
    type is important because each type is associated with different health issues.</string>

    <string name="impTurner">Why is it important to know if someone has Turner Syndrome?</string>
    <string name="impTurnerAns">Missing part of or all of one X chromosome is associated with a
    range of health, development, social and learning challenges which affects females with TS
        to different extends. It is important to diagnosis TS as early as possible
    so that your health care provider can determine whether you have health issues that need to be
    treated or watched.</string>

    <string name="treatTurner">Can Turner Syndrome be treated?</string>
    <string name="treatTurnerAns">TS is not a disease, but a genetic condition that is
    associated with a range of health concerns. TS is not directly treated by a health
    care provider, but the individual health concerns that arise are monitored and treated. New
    medical developments allow women with TS who are interested in starting a family seek the help
    of an obstetrician who specializes in-vitro fertilization. A girl with TS may get
    growth horomone under the supervision of a pediartric endocrinologist.</string>
